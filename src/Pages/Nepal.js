        <p className="sectionParagraphs">The Nepal Economic Sustainability Project will be building an industrial-sized chicken farm (about 1000 square feet) to provide income and financial sustainability for the Freedom School. The Freedom school is a school in rural Nepal that prevents human trafficking by providing education to girls and children at high-risk. The chicken farm will provide food for students, food security/sovereignty for the school and community, and income for local survivors and women operating the school.</p>
        <h1 className="sectionTitles">About the community</h1>
        <p className="sectionParagraphs">In 2019, the National Human Rights Commission estimated that 1.5 million Nepalis are vulnerable to human trafficking. Thus, the Freedom School, maintained and founded by Freedom and Hope Nepal and Her Future Coalition, serves 125 kids and 30 parents in adult education programs. The Freedom school aims to provide this education to prevent human trafficking and child marriage by making alternative economic and life options for children and families. The organizations also support 25 girls in residential care, who are at particularly high risk; employ survivors; and provide counseling to families. For our project, we felt inspired by these organizations' work and intend to ensure these programs can last forever through the economic and food assistance/sustainability provided by the chicken farm.</p>
